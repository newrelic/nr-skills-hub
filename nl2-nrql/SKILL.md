# Natural Language → NRQL

Turn a natural-language question into one correct, executable NRQL query. **Discover the schema first, run the finished query once to prove it parses, and return only the NRQL** — never a guessed query. See `queries.md` for the time-resolution response shape and the aggregator-function reference.

**Tools you use:**
- `list_available_new_relic_accounts` — find the account when the user didn't supply one.
- `convert_time_period_to_epoch_ms` — resolve any time range that isn't a plain "N units ago".
- `execute_nrql_query` — for schema discovery, then once more to confirm the final query parses. Needs `account_id` both times.

## Required inputs — stop and ask if any are missing

Three things must be settled before generating anything. Ask and wait if one is missing — never guess, and don't emit a `NRQL` block on a turn where you're asking.

1. **Account ID.** If not supplied, ask the user for it. Only call `list_available_new_relic_accounts` if they can't name one — it can return several hundred accounts in a single response, so never call it speculatively.
2. **The question itself.** If none was given, ask what to turn into NRQL — don't invent one.
3. **The time range.** If none is given, propose the default and get confirmation: *"No time range given — shall I generate this for the last 1 hour?"* Every query gets an explicit `SINCE`.

Beyond these three, don't ask follow-up questions — if the *interpretation* of the question is ambiguous, pick the most reasonable reading and proceed silently.

## Resolving the time range

**Plain relative ranges go in natively** — write `SINCE 1 hour ago` straight into the query; don't spend a tool call resolving it.

**Anything absolute, timezone-bearing, or compound** — "yesterday at 3pm", "from 9am until 30 minutes later", "at 9:48AM CST on 12/31/2025" — see `queries.md` for how to resolve it. Never call it with empty input — its own fallback is the last 24 hours, not this skill's 1-hour default — and treat the range as unconfirmed if `errors`/`warnings` comes back populated.

## Discovery workflow — MANDATORY, in this order

Run with `execute_nrql_query`, default window `SINCE 1 week ago` (widen/narrow only if a step returns nothing or is sparse — discovery is looking for what *exists*, not the answer). Never skip a step or assume an event type/attribute exists.

**(a)** `SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 week ago` → shortlist up to 3 plausible candidates. Only use event types this actually returned.
**(b)** `SELECT keyset() FROM <EventName> SINCE 1 week ago` — once per candidate. Returns every column plus its type (`string`/`numeric`/`boolean`).
**(c)** Sample only the attributes you're actually considering — `SELECT <attr1>, <attr2>, … FROM <EventName> SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 3` — to see real formats and units. Avoid `SELECT *`: wide event types carry 100+ attributes (`NrAiIncident` = 117), most irrelevant to the question.
**(d)** Choose the event type + attributes using (b) and (c) together — a column can exist in `keyset()` and still be empty or the wrong type.
**(e)** `SELECT uniques(<Attribute>, 20) FROM <EventName> SINCE 1 week ago` for every attribute headed into a `WHERE` clause — confirms exact stored casing/format (`'critical'` vs `'CRITICAL'`) before you filter on it. Combine these into one query where you can: `SELECT uniques(a, 20) AS a, uniques(b, 20) AS b FROM <EventName> …`.
**(f)** **If nothing survives, stop.** If no event type from (a) carries the attributes the question needs — or the ones that do hold no data in any reasonable window — say plainly which event types you checked and what was missing, and emit no `NRQL` block. Never substitute a near-miss event type, and never fall back to one (a) didn't return. "This account has no such data" is a valid answer; a query that returns `0` because the data isn't there is not.

## Building the query

- Use `FACET` to break results down by an attribute ("by user", "per host"); use `TIMESERIES` only for an explicit trend-over-time ask. `FACET` returns only the top 10 buckets unless you set `LIMIT` — always pair them, and use `LIMIT MAX` when the full breakdown matters.
- Pick the aggregator that matches the question rather than defaulting to `count()`/`average()`. `count`/`sum`/`average`/`max`/`min` cover most cases; for anything else, check `queries.md`'s aggregator table for the exact signature first — don't guess.
- Prefer aggregation over raw rows; if you do return rows, bound them with `LIMIT`.

## Check the query runs — REQUIRED before returning

Run the finished query once with `execute_nrql_query` (same `account_id` used for discovery). Decide from the response shape:

- **Failed to parse** — top-level `error` + `status: "failure"` naming the position of the problem. Fix and re-run until it comes back clean.
- **Parsed, with rows** — PASS.
- **Parsed, but empty** — the syntax is valid; this proves nothing about the schema. A nonexistent event type and a misspelled attribute both return `count: 0` with a success status. Disambiguate with one more query — `SELECT count(*) FROM <EventName> SINCE <same window>`, no `WHERE`:
  - non-zero → the event type and window hold data, so the filter is legitimately empty. PASS.
  - zero → the event type or the window is wrong, not the filter. Return to discovery once; if it still yields no candidate, stop per (f).

Keep the check's output in your thinking — it never appears in the response.

## OUTPUT FORMAT — CRITICAL RULE

Your entire response MUST be the literal line `NRQL` followed by one code block holding the query — nothing else:

````text
NRQL
```
[NRQL query here — nothing else, no explanation, no extra text]
```
````

- Keep **all** reasoning — discovery, schema exploration, query planning, the parse-check output — in your thinking. None of it belongs in the response.
- The response carries no prose at all: no preamble before the `NRQL` line, no explanation or caveats after the code block.
- The code block holds exactly one NRQL query.
- **Exceptions — emit no `NRQL` block at all.** Two cases, and only these two: (1) you're stopping to ask for a missing account ID, question, or time range; (2) discovery found no event type that can answer the question, per (f). Either way there's no query yet, so say plainly what you need or what's missing.

## Gotchas

- **`FACET` defaults to 10 buckets.** Without `LIMIT` you get the top 10 silently — a wrong answer, not a truncated one.
- **Empty results prove nothing about the schema.** A nonexistent event type and a misspelled attribute both return `count: 0` with a success status.
- **Spell time units in full.** NRQL rejects every abbreviation — `min`, `mins`, `hr` all fail with `unexpected '<token>'`. Full words work singular or plural, any case: `SINCE 1 minute ago`, `SINCE 30 SECONDS AGO`.
- **`convert_time_period_to_epoch_ms` is phrasing-sensitive.** Same meaning, different word order can fail: `"from 9am until 30 minutes later yesterday"` resolves, `"yesterday from 9am until 30 minutes later"` returns `errors`. On `errors`, rephrase once as `<range> <day>` and retry before giving up.
- **A point in time comes back as a range ending now.** `"yesterday at 3pm"` resolves to 3pm → present (~16 hours), not an instant. If the user asked about a moment, choose the window yourself.
- **Cap `uniques()`.** Unbounded it returns up to 1,000 values. `uniques(attr, 20)` is enough to confirm casing.
- **The same aggregator twice needs `AS` labels**, or the result display breaks: `SELECT median(a) AS 'med-a', median(b) AS 'med-b'`.
- **No implicit type conversion.** If discovery showed a number stored as a string, wrap it: `sum(numeric(unitPrice))`.
- **`keyset()` can list an attribute that holds no values.** Confirm with (e) before filtering on it.
- **The same attribute name can mean different things on different event types.** `NrAiIncident.priority` is `warning`/`critical`; `NrAiIssue.priority` is `HIGH`/`CRITICAL`. Never carry a value set across event types.

## Worked examples

### GOOD EXAMPLE — compound absolute range, two candidates

**User:** How many high-priority incidents opened yesterday between 9am and 9:30am?

*Reasoning — stays in thinking, never in the response:*

> "Yesterday between 9am and 9:30am" is compound/absolute → `convert_time_period_to_epoch_ms(text_input: "from 9am until 30 minutes later yesterday")` → `{start_time_ms: 1786006800000, end_time_ms: 1786008600000}`, no errors.
>
> `SHOW EVENT TYPES` → `NrAiIncident`, `NrAiIssue`, `Transaction`, …. Compared `NrAiIncident` vs `NrAiIssue` on `keyset()` + a targeted sample; `NrAiIncident` carries both `priority` and the open/close `event` field. `SELECT uniques(priority, 20)` → `["warning","critical"]`; `SELECT uniques(event, 20)` → `["open","close"]` — both lowercase, so "high-priority" maps to `'critical'`. `NrAiIssue.priority` uses a different vocabulary (`HIGH`/`CRITICAL`) — same attribute name, different event type, different values, which is why (e) is not optional. Straight row count → `count(*)`. Ran once: parsed clean and returned rows. (Had it come back empty, the next step is a bare `SELECT count(*) FROM NrAiIncident` over the same window — non-zero would mean the filter is genuinely empty, zero would mean the window or event type is wrong.)

*Response — exactly this, and nothing more:*

NRQL
```
SELECT count(*) FROM NrAiIncident WHERE priority = 'critical' AND event = 'open' SINCE 1786006800000 UNTIL 1786008600000
```

### BAD EXAMPLE (do NOT do this)

**User:** Show me error rate for my app

```sql
SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE error IS true) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago
```
This query may help, but here's how to read it and some caveats…

❌ Wrong for four reasons: (1) no discovery — `Transaction`/`error` assumed, never verified against `SHOW EVENT TYPES`, samples, `keyset()`; (2) no time range confirmed with the user — 1 hour silently assumed; (3) missing the `NRQL` line before the code block; (4) explanatory text **after** the code block, when the response must end at the closing fence.
